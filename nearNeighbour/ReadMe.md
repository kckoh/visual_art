# Implementation of nearest neighbour algorithm

## Steps:


1.Initialize all vertices as unvisited.
2.Select an arbitrary vertex, set it as the current vertex u. Mark u as visited.
3.Find out the shortest edge connecting the current vertex u and an unvisited vertex v.
4.Set v as the current vertex u. Mark v as visited.
5.If all the vertices in the domain are visited, then terminate. Else, go to step 3.

## To start
### Enter "node index"
### If you want to change the speed and the number of nodes,
### check variables and change it.
